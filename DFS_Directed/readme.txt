The file "graphin_another_example.txt" is just another example to show that the code is not example specific.
To use this file there are two ways:
-- Edit the graphin.txt file and change the values as that present in graphin_another_example.txt

OR

-- Edit the code and replace graphin.txt with graphin_another_example.txt in line number 67.

The above can be used for applying the code on any input file.

THANK YOU!!
